				<h3>Panamá Canal</h3>
				<p>There is no way you can miss seeing the 8th wonder of the world during your stay in Panamá. Coming in at about fifty miles long, the interoceanic Panamá Canal is the country's biggest attraction - literally. You can hop on a transit tour and share water with an 80,000 ton cargo freighter or check out the engineering marvel from about a half dozen spots in or around the capital like the Calzada de Amador and the Balboa Yacht Club, but the best views are from the four-story Miraflores Lock Visitor Center.</p>

				<h3>Casco Viejo</h3>
				<p>Like most metropolitans, Panamá City is divided into boroughs or corregimientos and one of the most popular is Casco Viejo. Spanish for old quarter, Casco Viejo is the historic district of the city and the orange-tiled roofs and Spanish colonial architecture are a welcomed contrast to the skyscraper skyline across the bay.</p>

				<h3>Calzada De Amador</h3>
				<p>Calzada de Amador, or Amador Causeway, stretches two miles into the Pacific and connects three islands to the mainland.

Calzada de Amador is also the gateway to The Day After's venue Figali Plaza and Convention Center.</p>
