## Application/Lib Directory

This directory contains all the specific libraries to the particular
site which this repository has been branched from. Typically the application
directory will be filled with 'class-*' files, for example there might be a
'class-api.php' file which would hold all the application (read: site) specific
logic relevant to API endpoints.
